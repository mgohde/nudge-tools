TODO:
1. Write user's manual for story input and sanity checking.
2. Write a tool to generate every possible story output. --> Base tool is done. Add more?
    --> At the top of each story path, add the computed total probability of each story chain happening. 
    --> To get point assignments, sum all possible paths to a specific ending and multiply by some fixed multiplier. OR "Good" vs "Bad"
    --> % completion? (per ending?)
    --> Given % completion over time, student data could be collected and used to inform training.
3. Share github repo.
4. Fix graph generator.
5. Write story removal or modification tool.

Future:
